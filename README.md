# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors game to be played in the browser.
Created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project was previously a Rock Paper Scissors game to be played in the console only. 

While converting this project to a browser based game, I learned:
* How to mainpulate the DOM and use Event Listeners
* How to create buttons that have affordance using CSS
* How to organize elements on the page with Flexbox
